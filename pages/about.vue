        Kelly grew up in a very country setting in Ohio. Her and Huck Finn
        would’ve been best friends! She loved the river, the woods, exploring
        every day and finding treasures wherever her day took her! She comes
        from a family of artists; her mom gave her the love of art and it was
        always in the back of her mind somewhere hiding.<br /><br />
        Fast forward to 2018 and that’s when she decided to pick up a paintbrush
        for the very first time! No real formal training, she decided to enroll
        in a local painting class and also enrolled in online classes to hone
        her skills. She gets inspiration for her paintings by just observing
        what’s around her in nature, her travels, people she’s met and people
        she admires. Painting women is her favorite subject. She has always been
        attracted to bright, bold colors and you can view that in most of her
        paintings. <br />
        <br />
        Kelly has lived in Boulder County for over 30 years. She lives with her
        husband and her ornery rescue dog, Max and her princess, Penelope, a
        King Charles Cavalier. She loves hiking everyday with her dogs, curling
        up with a book and binging the latest shows with her husband.
